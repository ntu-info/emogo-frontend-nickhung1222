[App Example]


Some students have encountered some version incompatibility issues because Tren used an older version of Expo (52.0.23) & Expo Router (4.0.15) in my export-router-mwe example.


Tren has updated the export-router-mwe example on COOL and GitHub Classroom using the latest Expo (54.0.1) & Expo Router (6.0.0). If you’re still having trouble running this example, please upgrade your Expo Go or simulators to the latest versions.


[Deployment for your own devices]


Simply follow this tutorial for a development build:


https://docs.expo.dev/tutorial/eas/configure-development-build/


Once you finished “eas build:configure” in the above page, run:


“eas build --platform ios --profile preview” for your iPhone
“eas build --platform android --profile preview” for your Android phone


Then you should able to see the building process (~15mins) on Expo’s website like this:


  



Click the [Install] button for more information.


You can also make a real dev build by:


“eas build --platform ios” for your iPhone
“eas build --platform android” for your Android phone


However, you have to deal with Google Play Store & Apple App Store deployment if you choose to go this way.


[Deployment for homework assignment]


Similar to [Deployment for your own devices], the only difference is to use “eas build --platform android --profile preview” in the last step no matter if you're an iPhone or Android user. 


This preview build will generate an .APK file that can be easily shared and installed (for Tren & TAs). Specifically, once you clicked the [Install] button in your project page on the Expo website, you’ll see a sharable link, such as

in the following figure. Please put this https://expo.dev/…. link in the README.md of your GitHub repo.
