# Human-AI Interaction History

## Session 1: Initial Setup and Feature Implementation

**User:** 請讀取readme.md 觀察要做什麼前置作業... 老師說這週要做到的事情如下...
**AI:** Analyzed the requirements:
1. App URI in README.md (Deployment)
2. RN source code + Human-AI interaction history
3. Data folder with exported data (3+ records, >12h span)

**User:** 第三個我們可以等12小時來重新輸入另一筆資料，沒關係。那你建議我們從哪邊開始著手？
**AI:** Suggested starting with implementing the App functionality (Emogo emotion recording) because data generation depends on it.

**User:** (Executed installation of async-storage)
**AI:** Implemented the main functionality in `app/(tabs)/index.js`:
- Added emotion selection (Happy, Calm, Sad, Angry)
- Implemented data persistence using `AsyncStorage`
- Added "Export Data" feature to easily copy JSON data for the assignment
- Added "Clear Data" for testing convenience

**User:** 手機還是不行 但網址可以 接下來適合做什麼？
**AI:** Since the web version works, the logic is correct. Proceeded to EAS Build setup.
- Modified `app.json` to remove template owner info and update package names to `com.nickhung1222.emogo`.
- Instructed user to run `eas build` commands.

**User:** (base) tzuyuan@hongziyuandeMacBook-Air-3 emogo-frontend-nickhung1222 % npm install -g eas-cli ...
**AI:** Confirmed installation. Guided user to login and configure EAS.

**User:** 遇到錯誤 `adb executable doesn't seem to work`。
**AI:** Clarified that `eas build` runs on the cloud. The error likely comes from trying to run the build locally after it finishes.

**User:** 所以他問我 Install and run the Android build on an emulator? 要選No?
**AI:** Confirmed to select **No**. The goal is to get the build URL for the README, not to run it on a local emulator (which requires Android Studio).
